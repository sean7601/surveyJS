# surveyJS 
 
 This is a basic html/css/js browser app to create, administer, and collate surveys. 
 It was built primarily to facilitate student feedback collection on classified networks without internet or server access 
 
 Step 1: Create your survey by adding the events, briefs, and exams applicable and then downloading the survey .json file  
 Step 2: Have students load the .json file after clicking "Take" and download their results into a designated folder  
 Step 3: Upload all the student survey results after pressing collate to get statistical summaries of survey data
